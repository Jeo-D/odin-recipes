    <h2>What is Injera?</h2>
    <p>Injera is a spongy, slightly sour flatbread from Ethiopia and Eritrea, considered to be the national dish of these two countries. It is a “plate”on a plate, with various dishes being piled on it and, using one’s fingers, one breaks off little pieces of the injera to scoop it all up.</p>
    <p>Injera is traditionally made with a combination of teff flour and wheat flour. This is because teff, being the world’s smallest grain, is fairly expensive and is also very intimidating in terms of flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Teff flour</li>
        <li>Rice flour</li>
        <li>Dry active yeast</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the teff flour, rice flour, yeast, sugar and water in a large ceramic bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Cover with a kitchen paper and leave somewhere warm to sit for 2 hours, to rise.</li>
        <li>If you don't have anywhere that's not cold (if it's winter), turn your oven light on, and place the starter in there.</li>
        <li>When you've reached the right stage, as described above, pour off the liquid at the top.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over high heat, boil 250ml water (1 cup). Add 80 ml (⅓ cup – use a proper measuring cup) of the injera batter to the boiling water, stirring continuously. Keep stirring until you get a thick porridge like batter.</li>
        <li>Take the saucepan off the heat and transfer the absit to a bowl and leave to cool to almost room temperature. This will take about an hour.</li>
    </ol>   
     <h2>Quick Steps-Method Two</h2>
    <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the yeast with a little bit of the warm water and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add whichever 2 flours you’re using, along with the salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually, add more warm water, stirring with a wooden spoon until you have a smooth batter, this time the consistency of thick pancake batter. Again, you may not need all the water.</li>
            <li>Cover with cling film and let stand for 1 hour</li>
            <li>After an hour, the batter would have increased slightly, give it a stir and pour the hot water, stirring constantly, until you get the thick crêpe batter we mentioned in the traditional method.</li>
            <li>Let stand for 20 minutes, then proceed to cook as above.</li>
